### Abstract:
The only text to cover both thermodynamic and statistical mechanicsâ€“allowing students to fully master thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. Presents essential ideas on critical phenomena developed over the last decade in simple, qualitative terms. This new edition maintains the simple structure of the first and puts new emphasis on pedagogical considerations. Thermostatistics is incorporated into the text without eclipsing macroscopic thermodynamics, and is integrated into the conceptual framework of physical theory.

### 1-2 THE SPATIAL NATURE OF MACROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS

Thermodynamics, in contrast (to mechanics, etc), is concerned with the macroscopic consequences of the myriads of atomic coordinates that, by virtue of the coarseness of macroscopic observations, do not appear explicitly in a macroscopic description of a system.

Among the many consequences of the "hidden" atomic modes of motion, the most evident is the ability of these modes to act as a repository for energy.

An energy transfer via the hidden atomic modes is called heat.

### 1-4 THE INTERNAL ENERGY

The development of the principle of conservation of energy has been one of the most significant achievements in the evolution of physics. The present form of the principle was not discovered in one magnificent stroke of insight but was slowly and laboriously developed over two and a half centuries. The first recognition of a conservation principle, by Leibniz in 1693, referred orily to the sum of the kinetic energy ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) and the potential energy ($mgh$) of a simple mechanical mass point in the terrestrial gravitational field. As additional types of systems were considered the established form of the conservation principle repeatedly failed, but in each case it was found possible to revive it by the addition of a new mathematical term-a "new kind of energy."

### 1-5 THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM

In some cases the evolution toward simplicity is rapid; in other cases it can proceed with glacial slowness. But in all systems there is a tendency to evolve toward states in which the properties are determined by intrinsic factors and not by previously applied external influences. Such simple terminal states are, by definition, time independent. They are called __equilibrium__ states.

> Postulate I. There exist particular states (called equilibrium states) of simple systems that, macroscopically, are characterized completely by the internal energy $U$, the volume $V$, and the mole numbers $N_1$, $N_2$ , $\dots$ , $N_r$ of the chemical components.

As we expand the generality of the systems to be considered, eventually permitting more complicated mechanical and electrical properties, the number of parameters required to characterize an equilibrium state increases to include, for example, the electric dipole moment and certain elastic strain parameters. These new variables play roles in the formalism which are completely analogous to the role of the volume $V$ for a simple system.

### 1-6 WALLS AND CONSTRAINTS

A description of a thermodynamic system requires the specification of the "walls" that separate it from the surroundings and that provide its boundary conditions. It is by means of manipulations of the walls that the extensive parameters of the system are altered and processes are initiated.

### 1-7 MEASURABILITY OF THE ENERGY

... We further observe that the rate of melting of the ice is progressively decreased by changing the wall surrounding the system from thin metal sheet, to thick glass, and hence to a Dewar wall (consisting of two silvered glass sheets separated by an evacuated interspace). This observation strongly suggests that the metal, glass, and [[Dewar walls]] are progressively less permeable to the flow of heat. The ingenuity of experimentalists has produced walls that are able to reduce the melting rate of the ice to a negligible value, and such walls are correspondingly excellent approximations to the limiting idealization of a wall that is truly impermeable to the flow of heat.

It is conventional to refer to a wall that is impermeable to the flow of heat as [[adiabatic]]; whereas a wall that permits the flow of heat is termed [[diathermal]]. If a wall allows the flux of neither work nor heat, it is restrictive with respect to the energy. A system enclosed by a wall that is restrictive with respect to the energy, volume, and all the mole numbers is said to be closed.

We can now proceed to our second concern-that of measurability of the energy. More accurately, we are concerned with the measurability of energy differences, which alone have physical significance. Again we invoke the existence of adiabatic walls, and we note that for a simple system enclosed by an impermeable adiabatic wall the only type of permissible energy transfer is in the form of work. The theory of mechanics provides us with quantitative formulas for its measurement. If the work is done by compression, displacing a piston in a cylinder, the work is the product of force times displacement; or if the work is done by stirring, it is the product of the torque. times the angular rotation of the stirrer shaft. In either case, the work is well defined and measurable by the theory of mechanics. We conclude that __we are able to measure the energy difference of two states provided that one state can be reached from the other by some mechanical process while the system is enclosed by an adiabatic impermeable wall__.

The entire matter of controllability and measurability of the energy can be succinctly stated as follows: __There exist walls, called adiabatic, with the property that the work done in taking an adiabatically enclosed system between two given states is determined entirely by the states, independent of all external conditions. The work done is the difference in the internal energy of the two states__.

In summary, we have seen that __by employing adiabatic walls and by measuring only mechanical work, the internal energy of any thermodynamic system, relative to an appropriate reference state, can be measured__.

### 1-8 QUANTITATIVE DEFINITION OF HEAT-UNITS

The fact that the energy difference of any two equilibrium states is measurable provides us directly with a quantitative definition of the heat: __The heat flux to a system in any process (at constant mole numbers) is simply the difference in internal energy between the final and initial states, diminished by the work done in that process__.


### 1-9 THE BASIC PROBLEM OF THERMODYNAMICS

The single, all-encompassing problem of thermodynamics is the determination of the equilibrium state that eventually results after the removal of internal constraints in a closed, composite system.

### 1.10 THE ENTROPY MAXIMUM POSTULATES

> Postulate II. There exists a function (called the entropy S) of the __extensive parameters__ of any composite system, defined for all equilibrium states and having the following property: The values assumed by the extensive parameters in the absence of an internal constraint are those that maximize the entropy over the manifold of constrained equilibrium states.

It must be stressed that we postulate the existence of the entropy only for equilibrium states and that our postulate makes no reference whatsoever to nonequilibrium states.

All problems in thermodynamics are derivative from the basic proble!ll formulated in Section 1.9. The basic problem can be completely solved with the aid of the extremum principle if the entropy of the system is known as a function of the extensive parameters. The relation that gives the entropy as a function of the extensive parameters is known as a fundamental relation. It therefore follows that __if the fundamental relation of a particular system is known all conceivable thermodynamic information about the system is ascertainable from it__.

> Postulate III. The entropy of a composite system is additive over the constituent subsystems. The entropy is continuous and differentiable and is a monotonically increasing function of the energy.

Several mathematical consequences follow immediately. The additivity property states that the entropy $S$ of the composite system is merely the sum of the entropies $S(\alpha)$ of the constituent subsystems:

$$
\tag{1.4}
S = \sum_\alpha S^{\alpha}
$$

The entropy of each subsystem is a function of the extensive parameters of that subsystem alone

$$
\tag{1.5}
S^{(\alpha)} = S^{(\alpha)} (U^{(\alpha)}, V^{(\alpha)}, N_1^{(\alpha)}, \dots, N_r^{(\alpha)})
$$

The additivity property applied to spatially separate subsystems requires the following property: __The entropy of a simple system is a homogeneous first-order function of the extensive parameters__ ([[note-20230303-023355|notes]]). That is, if all the extensive parameters of a system are multiplied by a constant A, the entropy is multiplied by this same constant. Or, omitting the superscript ($\alpha$),

$$
S(\lambda U, \lambda V, \lambda N_1, \dots, \lambda N_r) = \lambda S(U, V, N_1, \dots, N_r)
$$

> Postulate IV. The entropy of any system vanishes in the state for which:
> $$\Bigg(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\Bigg)_{V, N_1, \dots, N_r} = 0$$
> *(That is, at the zero of the temperature)*

It should be noted that an immediate implication of postulate IV is that $S$ (like $V$ and $N$, but unlike $U$) has a uniquely defined zero.

The condition also has direct implications upon the plot shape of S vs U
